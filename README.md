# Developer Security Essentials Package for Online Use

This package contains the materials for a facilitator to deliver the Developer Security Essentials package of three workshops to help developers improve their security and privacy decision-making. These materials are designed for remote/videoconferencing use; see the [face-to-face version](https://github.com/SecurityEssentials/face-to-face) for a face-to-face version.

This project is a placeholder to allow Github to host the release package for all to download.

Developer Security Essentials comprises three interactive workshops for client software developer teams. Developed with government funding by researchers from Lancaster University and UCL, the package is rigorously proven both to improve the teams' secure software development, and to promote good decision-making about security and privacy to give the organisations who do it a competitive advantage. The workshops are also good fun for the participants. The three workshops, of 1-1.5 hours each, are heavily interactive and engaging for the participating teams, using a range of sophisticated techniques to work either in person or through remote access:

1. An interactive game teaches that security is unthreatening and approachable;
1. An ideation ‘Threat Assessment’ session uncovers the security and privacy needs of participants’ current work; and
1. An analysis session identifies the business value for product management of the most important security and privacy enhancements.
 
The workshops work best run by software development experts — we recommend training  — and no security expertise is required. 

See the [Developer Security Essentials web page](https://www.securedevelopment.org/workshops/) for more details.
